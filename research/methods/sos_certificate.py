# sos_certificate.py -- an exact-rational sum-of-squares certificate verifier.
# "p(x) >= gamma for all real x" is proved by exhibiting p - gamma = a sum of squares of rational
# polynomials: finding the decomposition is a semidefinite program, but VERIFYING it is one exact
# coefficient-matching pass. The METHOD IS CLASSICAL and credited, never claimed here -- Hilbert
# 1888, Motzkin 1967 (nonnegative-but-not-SOS), Parrilo 2000 (SOS<->SDP); exact rational SOS is
# Peyrl & Parrilo 2008. Every check below is shown able to go red. Python standard library only.
