/* test-invariant.js — the GGR §4 clearing relation VERIFIED pathwise, its ray
   shown unique within the linear ansatz, and the obstruction beyond LQ.

   WHOSE RESULT THIS IS (novelty audit 2026-07-21, FINDINGS_LIT.md): ϖ+Π+cQ = 0
   IS the paper's balance condition — GGR §3.1 states Q_t = −(1/c)(ϖ_t + Π_t)
   as an identity in t. It is NOT a conservation law found here, and the value
   is 0, not an arbitrary constant. invDrift() below even seeds Π₀ = −C·Q̄ − w̄
   from that same condition, so inv0 ≡ 0 by algebra before any step is taken.
   What this battery certifies is the SCHEME: that the discretization carries
   the clearing constraint pathwise. The deformation checks (U7/U8) are
   SENSITIVITY, not evidence of clearing-forcedness — U8's drift is exactly
   linear in ε (see U8/U9), i.e. algebra.

   Tab 06 displays it conserved at ~5e-15 along every noise path. This battery
   characterizes the ray and the failure modes:

   1. THE RAY (symbolic, not computed here) — the ansatz I = c₀ϖ + c₁Π + c₂Q
      with pathwise dI ≡ 0 forces
      (drift cancellation)     c₂ = C·c₀
      (diffusion cancellation) (c₁ − c₀)·(a₂²(t) − C·a₂³(t)) = 0  for all t,
      so the ray is unique up to scale, (1,1,C), wherever the margin
      a₂²−C·a₂³ is alive (it dies only at t = T, where the terminal conditions
      collapse both coefficients). Uniqueness is WITHIN the ansatz class:
      constant-coefficient linear functionals. Nothing here rules out
      nonlinear, time-dependent or path-functional first integrals.
      [RETRACTED 2026-07-21] This header used to claim the battery "derives c₁
      by least squares, never assumes it". It does neither: c₀ = 1 and c₂ = C
      are imposed, and the least squares is a tautology — see U1.
   2. ε-SENSITIVITY, and what it is NOT. [RETRACTED framing 2026-07-21]
      This item used to read "KNIFE-EDGE … conservation is a structural
      consequence of clearing, not a generic feature." The drift is now
      DERIVED rather than plotted (P1-3), and it is exact for every ε:
          dI^ε = −ε·(C + a₂²(t))·s_S(t)·dW          (U8, pathwise 4.7e-13)
      Being exactly LINEAR in ε (U9) with a coefficient that never mentions
      the deformation mechanism, this is an algebraic consequence of rescaling
      one diffusion coefficient. It does NOT establish clearing-forcedness —
      a₂², a₂³ here are still the UNPERTURBED LQ solutions, so nothing was
      re-derived from a perturbed clearing condition (P1-2, R1 was right).
      What the exact form DOES give, and it is stronger than the old claim:
      the increment is pure dW with no dt term, so the deformed invariant is a
      MARTINGALE with Var[I^ε(T)−I(0)] = ε²·E∫(C+a₂²)²s_S²dt.
   3. THE RANK OBSERVATION — SCOPE CORRECTED 2026-07-21 after a literature
      check, which found the previous phrasing FALSE as written.
      A SINGLE vector field always admits n−1 independent local first
      integrals near a non-equilibrium point (flow-box / straightening
      theorem), so "full rank ⇒ no first integral" is impossible for one flow.
      The argument is only valid for a FAMILY. Ours is one: X_d (drift) and
      X_σ (diffusion). For an Itô SDE, I is a first integral iff D₀(I)=0 AND
      D_α(I)=0 for every diffusion component — so the right statement is about
      functions annihilated by BOTH fields, and full bracket rank is exactly
      Hörmander's condition, giving open Stroock–Varadhan support and hence no
      nonconstant common invariant. That chain is STANDARD (Sussmann, Trans.
      AMS 180 (1973); Olver Ch.1; Hörmander), and is cited, not claimed.
      The words "no-go", "non-integrable" and "KAM" are BANNED here — each
      summons a reviewer objection this computation cannot answer (see
      docs/FINDINGS_LIT.md). For the state-dependent loading L = load(t)(1+εQ),
      a hand-edited stand-in built on UNPERTURBED a₂², a₂³, no C¹ function is
      annihilated by both fields near the tested point:
      the Lie closure {X_d, X_σ, [X_d,X_σ], [X_σ,[X_d,X_σ]]} of
      the drift/diffusion fields attains full rank on an open set, so any F
      annihilated by all of them is locally constant. At ε = 0 the closure
      is rank-deficient everywhere (the rows are ⊥ dI — that IS the
      invariant), and the determinant is the measured certificate either
      way. All brackets are computed from closed-form coefficient
      derivatives (the a-ODEs' own right-hand sides); no finite differences.

/* ================= 1 · the ray, and why no numerics can derive it =========
   [RESTRUCTURED 2026-07-21] U1/U2/U4 used to fit c₁ by least squares over the
   coefficient flow and report c₁ = 1.00000000000000 as the derivation. That
   was unfalsifiable. With A := a₂²−a₂³·load and b := load−C, one has A ≡ b
   ALGEBRAICALLY (both equal (a₂²−C·a₂³)/(1+a₂³)), so the fit computed
   Σ(A·b)/Σ(A²) = Σ(A²)/Σ(A²) = 1. It returns 1 for white noise.

   The same algebra kills any fancier numerical route. Stacking the two
   cancellation conditions per t gives rows
       r₁ = (−C, 0, 1)                    (drift)
       r₂(t) = (−load(t), A(t), 1)        (diffusion)
   and since A ≡ load−C, r₂(t) = r₁ + (load(t)−C)·(−1, 1, 0) for ANY
   coefficients whatsoever. So the row space, hence the null space (1,1,C), is
   fixed by the MODEL'S DEFINITIONS — the price drift being −C× the supply
   drift, and the clearing loading — and does not depend on the a-ODEs at all.
   No experiment on the coefficient flow can derive it, and none should claim
   to. The ray is symbolic; see FINDINGS_LIT.md. It is also, as the novelty
   audit records, the coefficient vector of GGR's own §3.1 balance condition.

/* ---- U8/U9: the deformation drift is EXACT, and that is what demotes it ----
   ADVERSARIAL_REVIEWS P1-3 asked for "breaks at O(ε)" to be promoted from a
   plot to a proposition. It is stronger than first order. With I = ϖ+Π+CQ and
   load^ε = load·(1+ε), the ϖ- and Π-increments give

       dI^ε = [ sP(1+a₂³) + sS(a₂²+C) ] dW
            = −ε·(C + a₂²(t))·s_S(t)·dW          EXACTLY, for every ε

   because sP = −load^ε·sS makes sP(1+a₂³) = −(C+a₂²)(1+ε)sS. Two consequences:
     ε = 0  → pathwise conservation. That is GGR §3.1, THEIR relation.
     ε ≠ 0  → the increment is PURE dW with no dt term, so I is a MARTINGALE,
              not merely non-conserved, with
              Var[I^ε(T) − I(0)] = ε²·E ∫ (C+a₂²)² s_S² dt.

   AND THE PROPOSITION IS WHAT CONFIRMS P1-2 (R1's charge, [VERIFIED] here).
   The drift is exactly LINEAR in ε with a coefficient that does not involve the
   deformation mechanism at all. So U8 measures an algebraic consequence of
   rescaling one diffusion coefficient — it does NOT test "clearing-forcedness".
   A genuine test must perturb the CLEARING CONDITION and re-derive the
   coefficient ODEs; a₂², a₂³ here are still the unperturbed LQ solutions.
   U8 is therefore labelled for what it is, and its old "knife-edge" framing —
   which implied a structural fact about clearing — is retracted. */
