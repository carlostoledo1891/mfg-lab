/* lab-fixtures.js — the kernels the Lab batteries study.

   Shared rather than copied. Two batteries need a solver with a real,
   linearly-converging iteration, and two copies of one would drift in exactly
   the way `eqcert/tests/test-single-source.js` exists to prevent one level
   down. One implementation, parameterised.

   WHY JACOBI AND NOT CONJUGATE GRADIENTS — a fixture mistake worth keeping.
   CG has FINITE TERMINATION: on an m-unknown system it reaches the exact
   answer in m steps, so at m=15 the residual fell from 4e-2 to 2e-16 in a
   single iteration and every tolerance below that returned bit-identical
   output. The tolerance knob was inert, so the order study's contamination
   test had nothing to detect and passed trivially — a green check measuring
   nothing. Jacobi converges linearly (spectral radius cos(pi h) for the
   Laplacian), so the error moves continuously with the tolerance. It is also
   the honest fixture for this lab's domain: fictitious play, Picard and
   fixed-point MFG solvers converge linearly and none terminate finitely.

/* Jacobi for the shifted 1D Dirichlet operator  -u'' - k2 u = f  on (0,1),
   discretised by central differences on n intervals (m = n-1 interior nodes).

   k2 = 0 is the Laplacian. k2 > 0 is Helmholtz, whose Jacobi iteration matrix
   has spectral radius 2cos(pi h)/(2 - h^2 k2): it crosses 1 at k2 = 4 sin^2(pi h/2)/h^2,
   which tends to pi^2. So this one parameter carries a genuine, derivable
   failure boundary at k ~ pi — the first eigenvalue — which is what makes it
   a fixture for the failure map rather than an invented one.

   Bails out on non-finite iterates: a real solver does, and it keeps a
   divergent point from spending its whole iteration budget on NaN. */
